Week 1 :-

1) In the first class we learned the importance of quality while developing any product or software and how can we satisfy the user.
2) And we also learned how can we made quality software like Pokemon Go.
3) we also learned how can we saw an existing software from User point of view as well as Developer point of view .
4) And i also got idea about what kind of problem we are going to face while developing any software.
5) We also saw the various problem and limitation of Pokemon Go and how the different groups among us came up 
   with their own new and improved ideas.
6) We also learned karno model and classified our own ideas on the basis of Satisfier, Delighters, Dis-satisfier.


Week 2 :-
1) We discussed on various projects on which we have to work in this sem.
2) We also learned how can we over come various problem while developing software.
3) we also discussed the importance of quality in details.
4) We also discussed the different criteria which we have to kept in our mind while developing 
   any software like - Time-factor,Size,color,budget.
   

Week 3:-
1) we got familier with actual meaning of Software Engineering.
2) We also discussed the various scope or different position at which we have to woks as a software engineer.  
3) We also discuss about the problems in software distribution and maintainance.
4) We also work on a problem that what is similarity and de similarity between Software Engineering and Movies Making.

Week 4:-
1) We got familier with life cycle of software and we compare it with human life cycle.In this we mainly discuss about the 
   four main influence factor i.e People, Product, Process and tools.
2) We also discussed about different models for software development: 
   a)Traditional model(plan-driven) :-Traditional methodologies are characterized by a sequential series of steps like 
                                      requirement definition, planning, building, testing and deployment.
                                      And we came to know that Waterflow model and prototyping model and mainly 
                                      derived under traditional model
   
   b)Agile model :- Agile development model is also a type of Incremental model. 
                    In this model Software is developed in incremental, rapid cycles .Because in this model we
                    remove the unwanted steps and increase the production.
                    We also saw an example in which the TOYOTA CAR PRODUCTION COMPANIE became the best car production 
                    companie by using Agile model.
3) We also tried to learned about stakeholders of both Problem world and Solution world 
   and the fundamental requirements of any software.
